=================

Remind people to write for the PLM Tech Blog at: http://tech.patientslikeme.com/
Doesn't have any useful commands, just reminds people to write for the blog, randomly picking someone to suggest might want to write for it.

Commands:

* blog reset - Really only useful for testing, makes it forget that it already reminded someone to write for the blog today.
